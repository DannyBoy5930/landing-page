Reflections:
 - Flexbox and Grid both have their places to use, like in the 4 image gallery I used Grid instead of Flexbox for evenly sized boxes regardless of the content size.
 - This is certainly not best practice.
 - How do you get each container div evenly sized between each other?
 - Was fun!
